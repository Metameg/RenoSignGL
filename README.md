# RenoSignGL
# Author Alex Metzger

This project uses OpenGL to re-create the sign that is located in downtown Reno. The model uses a mixture of cube, cylinder, sphere, and prism meshes.
The site credited for generating the cylindrical and spherecial meshes is http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_cylinder.html. 
Opening the RenoSignGL.exe file should be enough to load the project as long as all files are downloaded correctly into the same directory as presented on this page. Enjoy.
